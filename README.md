# CO2eDEX

This is the official repo of the CO2eDEX decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the CO2e blockchain. CO2eDEX allows users to trade tokens in a permissionless manner using an automated market maker (AMM) model.

## About CO2eDEX

CO2eDEX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the CO2e blockchain that allows users to trade tokens in a permissionless manner. The DEX utilizes an automated market maker (AMM) model to facilitate trading without relying on order books.

Key features:

- Trade tokens in a decentralized manner without permission
- Uses an AMM model instead of order books
- Users can provide liquidity to earn fees and $BONE governance tokens
- $BONE tokens are earned through staking and pooling
- Aims to be a fast, secure, easy way to trade tokens in a decentralized manner

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Development

- [x] Implement basic token swap functionality
- [x] Add initial liquidity pools for major token pairs
- [x] Implement staking rewards for liquidity providers
- [x] Add more token pairs

### Phase 2: UI / Code / Optimisation

- [x] Upgrade to React 18
- [x] Fix any issues discovered during upgrade
- [ ] Perform additional testing
- [ ] Establish bug bounty program
- [ ] Create a functional graph
- [ ] Have public available analytics

### Phase 3: Governance Integration

- [ ] Integrate decentralized governance mechanism
- [ ] Allow $BONE holders to vote on protocol changes
- [ ] Implement on-chain voting for new feature proposals
- [ ] Build governance dashboard
- [ ] Establish process for proposing upgrades

## Getting Started with CO2eDEX

To start using CO2eDEX, you first need to connect to the CO2e blockchain. Here are the details on how to do that:

### 1. Install a CO2e-Compatible Wallet

You'll need a crypto wallet that is compatible with the CO2e blockchain. We recommend using MetaMask, which supports CO2e out of the box. Just download and install MetaMask.

### 2. Configure MetaMask for CO2e

Once MetaMask is installed, you need to configure it to connect to the CO2e network:

- Open MetaMask and click on the network dropdown (top center).
- Scroll down and select "Custom RPC".
- Enter the following network details:
  - Network Name: CO2e
  - New RPC URL: https://sichang-rpc.thaichain.org
  - ChainID: 24734
  - Symbol: CO2E
- Click "Save" to add the CO2e network.

### 3. Get Some CO2E Tokens

You'll need some CO2E tokens in order to trade on CO2eDEX. 
You can buy them at https://mintme.com

Once you have CO2E in your wallet, you're ready to start using CO2eDEX!

### 4. Connect Your Wallet to CO2eDEX

Go to [dogswap.com](https://usdog.fi) and click "Connect Wallet" in the top right. This will bring up your MetaMask wallet. Confirm the connection and you're all set!

Now you can start swapping tokens and providing liquidity on CO2eDEX. Let us know if you have any other questions!

## Supporting CO2eDEX

If you wish to support development, you can purchase CO2eDEX tokens on the CO2e website. You can register here: https://www.mintme.com/token/CO2eDEX/invite (new users get a bonus).

## Legal

CO2eDEX is an open source protocol that allows for decentralized token exchange on the CO2e blockchain. Usage of the protocol is governed by the MIT license found in the LICENSE file.

While CO2eDEX enables decentralized trading, users trade tokens at their own risk. The CO2eDEX developers and community members are not responsible for any loss of funds. Users should do their own research on tokens before trading them.

Some key legal considerations when using CO2eDEX:

- CO2eDEX does not custody user funds. Users maintain control of their wallets and tokens at all times.

- There are smart contract risks inherent to decentralized finance. Users should exercise caution when approving token contracts and understand the risks involved.

- CO2eDEX does not provide investment advice. Users trade tokens at their own discretion.

- Users are responsible for any taxes associated with their trading activity. CO2eDEX does not collect user information or report trades to tax authorities.

- CO2eDEX does not block access to any users or jurisdictions. It is the user's responsibility to ensure they comply with applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction.

- CO2eDEX code is provided as-is without warranty. Users assume all responsibility for risks associated with using the protocol.

We strive to make CO2eDEX open, transparent and easy to use. But users should exercise caution, do their own research, and understand the risks before using any decentralized protocol. Please use CO2eDEX responsibly!
